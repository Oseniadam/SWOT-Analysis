Strengths and weaknesses are internal while opportunities and threats external to the company. 

SWOT analyzes can be used at many levels in a business: for a team, department, project, or a whole company. 

It is a well-known tool, that is simple to use and understand. 

It is best carried out by a team who have prepared in advance by ‘walking the halls’ talking to staff and canvasing customers.

# How to do a SWOT
To do a SWOT analysis get your team together and answer the following questions about your organization or project: 

What Strengths do we have? (How can we take advantage of them?) 

What Weaknesses do we have? (How can we minimize them?) 

What Opportunities are there? (How can we capitalize on them?)

What Threats do we face? (How can we avoid or neutralize them?) 

Winning tip for successful SWOT! 

McGrath and Bates note that most SWOT analyzes are next to useless because people forget that a strength is only a strength if it provides a competitive advantage, and a weakness is only a weakness if it causes a competitive disadvantage. 

For example, having a great product is only a strength if it really is better than the competition, and having a newly trained team is only a weakness if it means you are more likely to lose out to your competitor(s). 

# Questions to help identify your Strengths 
What are our unique strengths? For example, most HR teams are qualified and experienced what is unique about us? 
What makes us stand out against the competition? 
What would our competitors say we are good at? 
What do our customers like best about us/our product? 

# Questions to help find your Weaknesses 
What does our competition do better? 
Why do we lose against [competitors name]? 
What do our competitors do that we don’t? 
What do our competitors have that we don’t? 
What do our customers like least about us? 
What is the biggest complaint?
